This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a mismatch between the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file and the actual installed packages. This often happens after manually installing or removing packages using `npm install` or `yarn add`. The Expo CLI might attempt to use a version or package that's not present in your node_modules folder, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
