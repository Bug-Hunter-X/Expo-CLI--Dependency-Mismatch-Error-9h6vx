The solution involves ensuring your `package.json` and installed packages are synchronized.  You can achieve this by reinstalling your project's dependencies.  The `expoBugSolution.js` file demonstrates this:
1. Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
